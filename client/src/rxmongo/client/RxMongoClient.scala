/** Primary Application Interface To RxMongo
  *
  * Each RxMongoClient instance provides a separate interface to MongoDB. It can manage connections to multiple
  * replica sets and coordinate the activity between them. Your application must instantiate an RxMongoClient in order
  * to use RxMongo as all other object provided by RxMongo are accessed through this. You may instantiate multiple
  * RxMongoClient instances, but each will maintain its own set of connections and view of the databases. This may be
  * useful in testing but is unlikely to be useful in an application unless you wish to keep replica set traffic very
  * separate.
